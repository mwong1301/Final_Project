Name: Volume Circle generator
Project Status: Finished on 12/13/23


Description:
This project works with the microphone to get data, it converts the data into an array of set of numbers to be able to compute it into a volume number using the equation for RMS.
The volume number found through the RMS equation is then used to create a randomized color, and radius for the circle.
This project loops through 50 times, the project continuously records until it fully loops through 50 times. So at the end you will have 50 circles.
Each time after a circle is drawn I have the pen move back to the set position (0,0) so that it looked different and more dynamic than just a bunch of circles on the screen.

Installation
For this project I installed pyaudio, turtle, and numpy by searching through the packages within python.
